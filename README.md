## Experience 

### Beat - Sr. Software Engineer -> Engineering Manager @ Fraud Safety and Identity (2019 - ...) [BEAT](https://thebeat.co)
Ride-hailing application. Part of the FreeNow group. Fraud, safety, and identity.

As a software engineer and engineering manager in the Safety team, 
my main responsibility was to make sure that no one gonna be harmed given that 
we operate in very violent conditions.

My day-to-day duties: 
- Research, design, and implement instruments for incident prevention via rules management, data analysis, and KYC procedures 
- Build tools to take proactive and reactive measures
- Lead technical design reviews and code reviews
- Own the full lifecycle of components and services in the Beat stack along with my team, including architecture design and planning, development, testing, deployment and production support
- Individual contributor to the features and the tasks of the team
- Work with Product Owners to understand desired application capabilities and features
- Establish a suitable team process and a continuous improvement environment
- Manage the performance and career development of team members, working with them to define goals, track progress, and give feedback
- Hiring manager for the Fraud, Safety and Identity team

I've done it using this: 

Golang, k8s, docker, AWS, MySQL, DynamoDB, aerospike, Kafka, 
gRPC, and many more. Packed in a beautiful and shiny set of µServices. All of it 
came with nice tooling to make sure everything works as expected.
